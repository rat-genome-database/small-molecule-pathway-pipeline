      SMP63644_proteins.csv ...

    and the new pathway names are like:
    48349|SMP:51243|Cardiolipin Biosynthesis CL(i-12:0/i-12:0/i-16:0/a-13:0)
    48350|SMP:51244|Cardiolipin Biosynthesis CL(i-12:0/i-12:0/i-16:0/a-15:0)
    48351|SMP:51245|Cardiolipin Biosynthesis CL(i-12:0/i-12:0/i-16:0/a-17:0)
